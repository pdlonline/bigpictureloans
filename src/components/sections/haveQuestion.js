In the event of non-payment, additional charges may be applied. Late payment penalties vary by lender, and as Opportunity-loan is not involved in the lending process, we cannot supply any information on the fees you will incur if any default occurs.

    Opportunity-loan is not a lender and we do not check your credit standing and credit capacity.
    When you submit a request at our online platform, this is considered a soft inquiry and does not impact your credit score.
    However, some lenders may carry out a credit check to ascertain your eligibility for a loan.
    Most likely they will turn to any of the three major credit bureaus (Transunion, Experian, and Equifax) that is in most cases considered a hard inquiry and may affect your credit score.
